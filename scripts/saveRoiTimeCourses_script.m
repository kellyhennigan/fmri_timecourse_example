% script to save out roi time courses. This script does the following:

% load event onset files: each file should be a text file with a column
% vector of 0s and 1s to signify an event onset. Length of the vector should be
% equal to the # of acquired TRs.

% load roi binary mask files: volumes w/value of 1 signifying which voxels
% are in the roi mask; otherwise 0 values

% load pre-processed functional data & get averaged roi time courses

% get stim-locked time series based on event onset files

% for each subject, for each roi, for each event type, get the average time
% course & save out in csv file. A separate csv file is saved for each ROI
% for each event type/condition, with subject timecourses in rows.
